        <p class="lead mb-4">Hostess @ Slater's 50/50 in Downtown Riverside<br><br>

        I am a full-time student in my 3rd year at University of California, Riverside studying Sociology. I am planning on acquiring my B.S. in Sociology, then to travel and work for a few years to discover what I want to do. I am also a part-time hostess at Slater's 50/50 in Downtown Riverside. I have only been working here for a few weeks but the fast-paced environment is the place to be, especially because it brings a lot of opportunities to learn and grow as a person and as a worker. <br><br>

        In my free time, I tend to enjoy video games, hiking, and socializing with my friends. Some of my friends and I have used our love for video games and created a discord and minecraft server for many people to join. Along with that, there is the promotion side of expanding our creation. This includes different types of social media including: twitter, tiktok, and instagram. In the aspect of tiktok, I have been involved in managing the account, making short clips and recording footage from the events that are held, and creating new ideas for our team. <br><br>
        
        Before I had gotten into gaming and running servers, I worked part-time in many places. For my first job, I work as a swim instructor at Scuba Schools of America. At the job, I was responsible for taking care and watching people's kids in swimming pools and in the environment for scuba diving. I was also responsible for maintaining the peace and resolving customer issues, as well as maintaining the facility to the highest possible standard. This included the parking lot, the pool, the restroom, the store, and the customer lounge.<br><br>
        
        Then I worked at John's Incredible Pizza Company. At this job, I was responsible for resolving issues that customers brought up to me, mostly involving the game systems in Funworld. I was also responsible for maintaining the facility for the highest standard, which included sweeping, moping and wiping down any and every surface. When fixing game systems, I had learned a lot about how the technology worked within the system and became efficient and quick and resolving the issues of the broken games. I was also a ride operator for the rides in the facility. This includes maintaining the safety of all guests and their families in and outside of the ride area. <br><br>
        
        After John's Incredible Pizza Company, I worked at Target, Co. as a cashier. Here I worked in a fast-paced environment alwasy resolving issues and maintaining the customers happiness and satifaction with their experience. In this job, I was responsible for managing money for a company and being on the look out for an items being stolen. <br><br>
        
        After Target, I worked at the Van Buren Drive-in. I was responsible for money management and maintaining customers needs, also occasional jump starts for people who had dead batteries.
